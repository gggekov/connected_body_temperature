# Introduction
This repository contains an application of reading a body temparture sensor and pushing the sensor reading to the cloud. We're using the [Arm Pelion IoT](https://www.pelion.com/) cloud in the example. 
### Required hardware
- [ST Discovery IOT01 board](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-L475E-IOT01A)
- [MAX30205 human body temperature sensor](https://os.mbed.com/components/MAX30205-Human-Body-Temperature-Sensor/)
### Setup 
1. Create a [free-tier account on Arm Pelion](https://os.mbed.com/pelion-free-tier/) 
2. Clone this repository
3. Download a developer certificate from your Pelion account. Place the certificate in the root of the project
4. Connect the sensor to the ST Discovery board
